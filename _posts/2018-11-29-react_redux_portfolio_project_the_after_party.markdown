For my final project, I built a React app called The After Party. It took me a very long time to come up with an idea that both fit the criteria and interested me. What I came up with is the following: 
1. Users can browse a database of concert venues along with their ratings and reviews
2. Users can rate and review venues
3. Users can browse, like/dislike, and leave suggestions for places to go after the show

I came up with the idea after having a lot of conversations with people about where to go before and after shows at different venues. It also grew out of the desire to have better ratings for venues as I’ve often felt that has been lacking on other sites. So the motivation for this project was to build something that I would want to use myself on a fairly regular basis. 

I experimented with using Material-UI (aka Google’s Material Design) for the UI framework. Working with a React framework was a very different experience than working with something like Bootstrap and CSS. 

Some ideas that I have for future iterations of this app include:
* Adding more criteria for people to review the venue(s) on e.g. bathrooms, acoustics, etc. 
* Allow users to add new venues, or perhaps boost the existing database with information gained from an external API and/or web scraping
* Be able to sort and/or filter different suggestions for a venue
* Enable users to save suggestions to a list
