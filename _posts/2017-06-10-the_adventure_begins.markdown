*So who am I and why have I decided to learn software development? *

I’ve gone through a number of different phases and careers so far. In college I was determined to take my art history degree, turn it into a PhD and become a museum curator. After college, I took that passion for art and used it to fuel a few years in PR, but it never felt truly fulfilling. About two years ago, I took a job as a temporary admin assistant at a FinTech firm and that’s where, more or less, I discovered my interest in programming. 
 
It all started with a program called FileMaker. My boss at the time asked me to replace the Excel spreadsheet that the admin team was using to track subscriptions with a fully-functional database. I knew zero about FileMaker when I started out, but I was determined to succeed. Through a combination of Lynda.com videos, FileMaker books, reverse engineering, late nights, and, of course, Google, I managed to produce a functioning database three months later.
 
After hearing me rave about my project for weeks on end, a friend introduced me to the idea of becoming a dev and suggested that I explore some free online coding tutorials. The next day I signed up for Codecademy and started learning Python. The rest is history. What I learned from my FileMaker project and what the Python course reinforced for me, was that building something, learning, solving puzzles, getting stuck and finally figuring out how to get unstuck was incredibly captivating and I wanted to do more.
 
Long story short(ish), I’ve committed to learning software development because I truly find it an exciting and rewarding experience. I can’t wait to learn more!
